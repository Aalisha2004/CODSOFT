****CODSOFT Projects****

This repository contains projects developed during the CodSoft Internship Program. The projects demonstrate fundamental concepts in Java programming and are intended to be educational.

Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to showcase the Java projects completed as part of the internship. Each project is designed to enhance coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of basic to intermediate Java concepts.

Projects Included:

_Task1 :Number Game_
A simple game that involves guessing a randomly generated number within a specific range.
How to Use: Run the NumberGame.java file, follow the prompts, and try to guess the correct number.

_Task 2:Student Grade Calculator_
A program that calculates a student's grade based on input scores.
How to Use: Run the StudentGradeCalculator.java file, input the required scores, and the program will output the final grade.

How to Run the Projects:
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Aalisha2004/CODSOFT.git
Navigate to the project directory.
Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., javac).
Run the compiled Java files using the command:
java [filename]
Replace [filename] with the name of the Java file you want to run.

_Task 3: ATM Machine Implementation_
Task 3 involves creating an ATM machine simulation in Java. This task includes developing a class to represent the ATM machine, along with the necessary methods for performing transactions like withdrawal, deposit, and balance checks. A separate class is created to represent the user's bank account, which is connected to the ATM. The project validates user input and displays appropriate messages based on the transactions performed.

Files Included:
ATM.java: This file contains the implementation of the ATM class, which includes methods for withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking the balance.
BankAccount.java: This file represents the bank account of the user. It holds the user's balance and includes methods to modify and retrieve the balance.
Main.java: This is the main class that ties everything together. It simulates the interaction between the user and the ATM machine.

How to Run the Code:
Compile the Code:
Navigate to the directory where the files are located.
Compile the Java files using the following command:
javac ATM.java BankAccount.java Main.java
Run the Program:
After successful compilation, run the Main class to start the simulation:
java Main

Interaction:
Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the ATM. You can perform tasks such as depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking your account balance.
Note: Make sure you have Java installed on your system to compile and run the program.
