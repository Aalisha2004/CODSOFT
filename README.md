**CodSoft Java Programming Internship - Task Overview**

During my Java Programming internship at CodSoft, I completed five tasks that demonstrate my programming skills and understanding of core Java concepts. Below is a brief overview of each task:

_1.Number Game_

Developed a simple interactive number game that allows users to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, and tracks the number of attempts.

_2.Student Grade Calculator_

Implemented a grade calculator that takes student marks as input and calculates the overall grade based on predefined criteria. This application also provides insights into the student's performance.

_3.ATM Machine Implementation_

Simulated an ATM machine with basic functionalities such as checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing money. The application ensures secure transactions and handles multiple user accounts.

_4.Quiz Application_

Created a quiz application that presents multiple-choice questions to users. The application keeps track of the score and provides feedback on the correct answers after the quiz is completed.

_5.Student Course Registration System_

Developed a course registration system for students to enroll in courses. The system handles student information, course availability, and registration statuses, ensuring smooth enrollment processes.
